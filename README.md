The project is based on 1M real-world used car data crawled from carfax.com. These data are used to analyze the used car market of US.
***

#####The project includes 3 parts:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis:
	
	In this part, I extract insight of used car market from data. Explore the specialities and relationship of features and visualize the findings. 
2. Statistical Test:

	In this part, I use statistical tests, like T-test, Anova(F-test), Pearson Correlation test etc. to generate strict conclusions backed by probabilites theories. 
3. Prediction model:

	In this part, I use machine learning models to evalute the price of the used car. The attempted regression models includes SVM, Random Forest, Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression etc. Also some feature engineering technologies like PCA, One-Hot Encoding etc. get integrated into the model. The tuning and selections of model is based on Grid-Search and Cross-Validation.
